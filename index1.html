                <h5 id="third-div-text">Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, 
                    industrial designer, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; 
                    the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors 
                    following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized 
                    as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business 
                    partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
                    Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after
                    his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through 
                    India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell
                    Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and 
                    sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial 
                    potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to 
                    the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first 
                    mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition 
                    of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.</h5>
